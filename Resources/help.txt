Amiga BootBlock Reader
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
ABR is a program that reads and writes the bootblock area of
Amiga disks. 


With this program you can:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
- View and identify bootblocks from ADF's and saved bootblock 
  files
- Batch scan your ADF files to find viruses / unknown bootblocks
- Save bootblocks to your PC harddisk from ADF's for backup 
  purposes / collection
- Install a variety of standard AmigaOS bootblocks to ADF's to 
  fix booting problems
- Learn new bootblocks with my 7-byte recognition system
  (sounds fancier than it actually is)
- Crash your computer and wipe your hard drive 
  (if your really lucky)


Adding bootblocks to the brainfile - Instructions:
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1/ After you have opened the disk with the bootblock you want 
   to learn change to the 'Add / Redo Recognition' tab on the 
   right side of the interface. 

2/ Examine the bootblock you want to learn, look for any version 
   numbers or text that would uniquely identify it.

3/ Click somewhere in the bootblock display and press the
   'Goto and Add location' button, the program will add  the 
   byte position and value into the textbox in the 
   'Add / Redo recognition' tab

4/ Repeat the above step until the program displays 
   'Max 7 Elements added' 

5/ A Textbox around the top should now appear asking for a new 
   bootblock name, enter it and choose a 'Classification' from 
   the 'Add / Redo Recognition' tab

6/ Click the 'Save Bootblock' button


Redo recognition of a Known bootblock
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
1/ Examine the bootblock, look for any version numbers or text 
   that would uniquely identify it.

2/ Click somewhere in the bootblock display and press the 
   'Goto and Add location' button, the program will add the
   byte position and value into the textbox in the 
   'Add / Redo recognition' tab

3/ Repeat the above step until the program displays 'Max 7 Elements added' 

4/ A Textbox around the top should now appear asking for a new 
   bootblock name, enter it and choose a 'Classification' from 
   the 'Add / Redo Recognition' tab

5/ Click the 'Save changes' button

It could be rife with problems and I would appreciate any feedback,
suggestions and coding help you could give me
